Repository with different algorithms for computational geometry.

# Installation

To run the code everything that you should have - Python >= 3.6 with tkinter support.

In general, to start the project you should:

- Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/ikhlestov/computational_geometry.git`
- Enter the directory `cd computational_geometry/`
- Start the code with `python3 main.py`

After you can use mouse to plot two lines on canvas and identify do they intersects or not.

# Development

- Create environment with `python3.6 -m venv .venv` or with any other means convenient for you
- Activate environment `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Install required packages `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run tests `./run_tests.sh`
